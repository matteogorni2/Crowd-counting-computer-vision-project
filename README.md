# Crowd-counting-computer-vision-project
In this project work we implemented several models to solve a crowd counting task in multiple ways.
the file Crowd_counting_density_approach contains an implementation of a CSRNet architecture to output respective image density maps as well as a predicted head count.
VCS_Crowd_counting, on the other hand, contains a few different model implementations to solve the task by giving a simple headcount as output
